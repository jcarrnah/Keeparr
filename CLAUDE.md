# CLAUDE.md — Keeparr contributor guide

Keep this file and README.md in sync when you change behavior, schema, routes,
or settings keys.

## What Keeparr is

Plex-login web app for deciding what media to **keep** and reporting what can be
deleted. Tag + report only — **never deletes**. Keep is **per-user** but
protective: an item is kept (safe) if **anyone** keeps it, and you can only
remove **your own** keep. Per user the states are **mutually exclusive**:
none / keep / "don't care" / **"OK to delete"** — the last is the original Seerr
requester signing off ("I'm done with it"), offered **only on items that user
requested** and **only when Seerr is connected**. "OK to delete" does NOT override
anyone else's keep (a marked item stays protected while someone keeps it); it's
surfaced on Big Picture (with who marked it) and filterable on Browse (by you / by
anyone — the by-anyone view never reveals who). "Don't care" ("skip the rest") is
per-user. See README.md for the feature overview.

## Canonical rules

- **Categories are the user's actual Plex libraries — never hardcode "Movies /
  TV / Anime".** Everyone's library setup differs; the feed filters and library
  sidebar are driven by `getPlexSections()` (section ids). `library_kind`
  (movie/show) is Plex's own section type and may be used internally (e.g. to seed
  some movies into the mixed feed), but it is not a user-facing taxonomy.
- All SQL lives in `lib/queries.ts`. Don't write SQL elsewhere.
- All external HTTP lives in `lib/plex.ts`, `lib/jellyfin.ts`, `lib/tautulli.ts`,
  `lib/seerr.ts`, `lib/arr.ts` (all built on `lib/http.ts` `fetchJson`). One
  deliberate exception: the poster proxy (`app/api/image/route.ts`) streams the
  upstream image bytes itself (fetchJson is JSON-only).
- All settings access goes through `lib/settings.ts` (typed getters; secrets are
  encrypted via `lib/crypto.ts`). Never read raw setting keys in routes.
- Route handlers are thin: auth-guard → call lib → return JSON. Use
  `requireUser` / `requireAdmin` from `lib/auth.ts` and `errorResponse` from
  `lib/route-helpers.ts`.
- Every route handler that touches SQLite/native code sets
  `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`.
- `lib/session.ts` must stay Edge-safe (Web Crypto only) — it's used by
  `middleware.ts`. No `node:` imports there.
- Tests use a real in-memory SQLite (`__setTestDbToMemory()`), never mocks for
  storage. Route tests mock only `next/headers` (the cookie jar) plus, where a
  test would otherwise hit the network or the real data dir, the
  network-facing lib clients (plex/jellyfin) or path config — never storage.
- The size unit on cards is `x.xx GB` via `formatGB` in `lib/format.ts`. Library/
  storage aggregates (sidebar sizes, the storage header) use `formatSize`, which
  auto-switches GB↔TB at 2 decimals.

## Architecture

```
middleware.ts        gate all routes behind a valid Plex session (Edge runtime)
instrumentation.ts   start the job scheduler on boot (Node runtime only)
lib/
  config.ts          env-derived config (DATA_DIR, SESSION_SECRET, APP_URL)
  db.ts              better-sqlite3 singleton + schema + test helpers
                     (+ closeDbForSwap() so backup restore can swap the db file)
  queries.ts         ALL SQL
  types.ts           shared DTOs
  format.ts          formatGB / formatSize
  crypto.ts          AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt for stored tokens
  session.ts         signed cookie (Edge-safe, Web Crypto)
  auth.ts            session read/write + requireUser/requireAdmin (Node)
  settings.ts        typed settings accessors (+ secret encryption)
  login.ts           pure access-control decision (decideAccess) — unit tested
  plex.ts            plex.tv OAuth + PMS read API + size summation helpers
  jellyfin.ts        Jellyfin/Emby client (MediaBrowser API): auth + server info +
                     users (+ library/item/watch reads added in later phases)
  tautulli.ts        watch-history client
  seerr.ts           requests client
  arr.ts             Sonarr/Radarr v3 client (shared) + pure normalize fns (fetchSonarr/fetchRadarr/testArr)
  quality.ts         pure resolutionBucket()/RES_ORDER (shared by Browse + Big Picture quality grouping)
  purge-verify.ts    **FORK:** post-delete disk check — did the bytes actually
                     leave? Reuses upstream's exported sizeOfDir/normalizeName
                     rather than editing lib/diskscan.ts (see FORK_SYNC.md).
                     Roots are re-listed per item on purpose: a listing taken
                     before a later delete would report phantom residue.
  source-actions.ts  **FORK:** the Problems page's "fix it where it lives"
                     actions — rescan/refresh a title in Sonarr/Radarr
                     (RescanSeries·RescanMovie / RefreshSeries·RefreshMovie, one
                     command per title: the singular/plural id fields differ
                     between the two apps AND across versions, so a batch
                     command risks acting on only the first), rescan or
                     **re-identify** an item on Jellyfin/Emby (FullRefresh +
                     replaceAllMetadata — the only real fix for missing/wrong
                     provider ids; images never replaced), and remove a stale
                     *arr RECORD (deleteFiles=false). That last one is the ONLY
                     removal, gated on `arr_unmatched.on_disk = 0` re-read from
                     the DB — never from the request. Per-title failures are
                     counted, not fatal. Also `sourceLinksFor()`: deep links
                     resolved server-side because every URL is a setting.
  post-delete-cleanup.ts **FORK:** finish a purge in the two systems the *arr
                     delete doesn't touch — clear the Seerr request (else the
                     title is re-requested and re-downloaded) and trigger ONE
                     Jellyfin/Emby library refresh (else the server serves empty
                     entries). Never throws; no-ops on an empty list, so dry-run
                     is safe by construction. Plex is skipped (no equivalent).
  paths.ts           pure separator-agnostic path-string helpers (lastSegment/
                     parentSegment/normalizeName) — foreign server-side paths may be
                     Windows-style, so never node:path
  diskscan.ts        the diskScan job — the REALITY-CHECK pass: (1) per mapped
                     library root, readdir top-level entries and flag names no
                     media item or *arr title claims (orphans get a recursive
                     size walk — known entries are never descended into);
                     (2) verifyArrUnmatchedOnDisk(): does each unmatched *arr
                     title's folder actually exist, and how big is it really
                     (arr_unmatched.on_disk/disk_size_bytes — also called after
                     every syncArr); (3) measure the real on-disk size of every
                     size-mismatched title (media_items.disk_size_bytes — the
                     Plex-vs-arr tiebreaker). Safety guard (skip mostly-unnamed
                     sections), wrong-mapping circuit breaker (record names,
                     skip sizing), mtime size cache, junk skip-list (JUNK_NAMES)
  version.ts         update check vs GitHub Releases (compareSemver + getVersionInfo,
                     in-memory ~6h cache, never throws — /api/about + health check)
  health.ts          healthIssues(): standing admin warnings derived from job_state/
                     settings/version cache (no live probes); each has a docSlug →
                     README anchor
  backup.ts          SQLite backup/restore: createBackup (online db.backup), list/
                     delete/prune (retention), restoreBackup (pre-restore snapshot →
                     closeDbForSwap → copy → reopen+migrate); files in DATA_DIR/backups
  mediaserver/       backend read seam: types.ts (MediaBackend interface + BackendSection/
                     BackendItem), plex.ts (adapter over lib/plex), jellyfin.ts (adapter over
                     lib/jellyfin; serves Jellyfin AND Emby), index.ts getBackend() factory
                     (by media_server_type). The sync engine reads through this, never a
                     backend directly.
  sync.ts            job runners (backend-agnostic via getBackend()): syncRecentlyAdded /
                     syncLibrary / syncSizes / syncWatchHistory / syncSeerrRequests / syncArr
                     (+ syncSeerrRequestsForUser: warm one user's request cache on first login).
                     syncLibrary also runs **FORK** `relinkReplacedItems()` after
                     tombstoning (a re-added title — 4K upgrade, library rebuild —
                     returns under a NEW rating_key, orphaning its keeps/watch
                     onto the tombstone and leaving the live copy unprotected and
                     rule-eligible; matched by tvdb/tmdb→imdb, never carries a
                     scheduled deletion forward).
                     syncLibrary aborts on zero sections + skips tombstoning
                     empty-but-200 sections; syncArr keeps a failed instance's cache
                     + records cross-instance claim collisions into arr_conflicts
                     (first instance to claim a rating_key wins arr_items; later
                     claimants are recorded, not silently dropped) + reality-checks
                     the fresh unmatched rows on disk (verifyArrUnmatchedOnDisk,
                     non-fatal)
  jobs.ts            job registry + runJob/runWithState (single-flight) + isDue/dueJobs
  scheduler.ts       per-job scheduler (interval or daily HH:MM); fires due jobs each
                     minute; resets stale 'running' job rows at boot (resetInterruptedJobs)
  cards.ts           MediaItem → MediaCardData (+ proxied poster URL)
  storage.ts         fs.statfs free/total per filesystem (Node-only); dedupes mounts

The chrome is a Sonarr/Radarr-style left rail (logo → Keep; Keep / Browse[expand
→ libraries] / **Swipe** / Big Picture / Problems[admin] / **Deletions**[admin]
/ Settings[admin]) + a
top bar (search + user menu). `AppShell` (client) wraps every page; the Keep page
renders inside it with no page scroll.
**Responsive:** the rail is docked on `md:`+ but a slide-in drawer on mobile
(hamburger in the top bar + tap-to-close backdrop, auto-closes on route change).
The shell root is sized `[height:100dvh]` (with `h-screen` as fallback) so the
no-scroll pages fit the *visible* mobile viewport, not behind the browser chrome;
the full-height single-screen pages (Swipe/Room) add `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`
padding so their bottom action buttons clear the gesture bar. Keep both when
touching that layout.

## Database schema (`lib/db.ts`)

- `media_items` — one row per **series or movie** (no episodes). `size_bytes` is
  the summed total. `dir_name`/`file_name` are the item's on-disk names as the
  media server reports them (movie: Part.file / item Path; show: Location /
  series Path) — the disk-orphan scan's known-name set; `dir_path` is the FULL
  server-side folder path (the Problems page's clickable Location cells). All
  NULL until a library scan captures them. **Some PMS versions omit `Location`
  from show listings entirely** — shows then get dir_path/dir_name DERIVED from
  episode file paths (`deriveShowDirPaths` in lib/paths.ts: first segment under a
  known section root, else parent-of-file hopping season folders) via
  `backend.showSize()`, which returns `{sizeBytes, dirPath, dirNames}`: new
  shows fill at scan time, existing shows are backfilled by the `sizes` job.
  A show's `dir_name` is **newline-joined** when its episodes span several root
  folders (the server merges multi-folder shows; every folder must count as
  known to the disk scan — split on '\n' when consuming).
  `disk_size_bytes`/`disk_checked_at` = the MEASURED size (diskScan walks
  size-mismatched titles' folders — the tiebreaker column). `file_count` =
  movies only: distinct video files merged into the item (>1 = a multi-part/
  multi-version item, so its Plex-vs-arr size mismatch is BY DESIGN — the
  Problems page badges those "likely fine" instead of "rescan"); NULL for
  shows and until a library scan captures it. ALL disk-name
  writes are COALESCE-style (upsertMediaBatch + updateItemSize): an incoming
  NULL keeps the stored value — scans that don't recompute a show (known size →
  no showSize call) must not wipe the sizes-job backfill (recentlyAdded runs
  every 5 min and did exactly that). Tombstoned with `removed=1` when
  gone from Plex. The full
  Library sweep aborts if the backend reports zero sections, and skips the
  removal check for scanned sections that returned zero items — an empty-but-200
  hiccup (e.g. PMS mid-restart) must not tombstone a whole library.
- `keeps` — per-user keeps. PK `(plex_user_id, rating_key)`; index on
  `rating_key`. An item is protected if **any** row exists for it; each user
  manages only their own keep. (Was a single global row per item; `migrate()`
  rebuilds the legacy table, carrying `kept_by` → `plex_user_id` — inside one
  transaction, so a crash rolls back to the intact legacy table; an orphaned
  `keeps_new` from an older crash is dropped and the rebuild redone.)
- `user_skips` — `(plex_user_id, rating_key)`; per-user "don't care". Mutually
  exclusive with that user's keep + "OK to delete" (the keep/skip/mark-delete routes
  clear the others).
- `user_deletes` — `(plex_user_id, rating_key)` + `marked_at`; per-user "OK to
  delete" (the requester signing off). Only settable on an item that user requested
  (`isRequestedByUser` gate, from `seerr_requests`). Mutually exclusive with that
  user's keep/skip. Indexed by user (`idx_deletes_user`) and item (`idx_deletes_item`,
  for the by-anyone view + the attribution join to `users`). Excluded from that
  user's feed (`FEED_ELIGIBILITY`).
- `users` — media-server accounts (`plex_user_id` is the internal id — historically
  Plex, now the Plex/Jellyfin/Emby account id); `is_admin` (first login / server owner),
  `enabled` (admin can block an account; Owner is exempt), `session_epoch` (bumped to
  invalidate that user's outstanding tokens — "sign out all devices" and admin-disable
  both bump it; session tokens carry the epoch at mint time and `getSessionUser` rejects
  a mismatch). Migrated via guarded `ALTER TABLE`.
- `watch_history` — `(plex_user_id, rating_key)` `plays` + `last_watched`, from
  **Tautulli (Plex)** or **native `UserData` (Jellyfin/Emby)** — `syncWatchHistory` uses
  `getBackend().getWatchData()` (native) and falls back to Tautulli when the backend has
  none. Powers the Browse **Watched** filter + the per-card watched badge (by you) and the
  Big Picture **never watched by anyone** metric. Indexed by user (`idx_watch_user`) and by
  item (`idx_watch_item`, for the by-anyone lookup). UI watch surfaces gate on
  `isWatchAvailable()` (Tautulli for Plex, native otherwise).
- `seerr_requests` — `(plex_user_id, rating_key)`; cached Seerr requests (refreshed
  by the `requests` job; badges/filters read this, not live Seerr). Also warmed
  for a single user on their **first login** via `syncSeerrRequestsForUser`, so
  "Requested by me" works without waiting for the daily job.
- `arr_items` — one row per matched media item with its Sonarr/Radarr metadata
  (`source`, `instance_id/name`, `arr_id`, `monitored`, `status`, `quality` +
  `quality_kind` file|profile, `root_folder`, `arr_size_bytes`, `tags` JSON,
  `folder_name` — the title's own *arr folder basename, part of the disk-orphan
  known-name set; **FORK:** `title_slug`, the *arr's own URL slug, so the
  Problems page can link a row straight to it). Keyed
  by `rating_key`; replaced per-instance by the `arr` job — instances that failed
  a run keep their cached rows; instances removed from settings drop out next
  run. LEFT-JOINed by `queryLibrary`
  to power Browse's List view + quality/tag/monitored/status/size-mismatch filters.
- `arr_unmatched` — Sonarr/Radarr titles that matched no Plex item. ALL of them
  are recorded with a `downloaded` flag (`sizeOnDisk > 0`): downloaded ones are
  media on disk Plex can't see (the "In *arr, not in <server>" category +
  Match health count — `getArrUnmatched()` defaults to downloaded-only);
  fileless ones only feed the identityMismatch folder-name join.
  `on_disk`/`disk_size_bytes` are the disk reality check (NULL = not verified;
  written by verifyArrUnmatchedOnDisk after each arr sync + diskScan) — the
  "In *arr, not in <server>" table's On-disk column ("not found"/"empty" =
  stale *arr record). Replaced
  per-instance by the `arr` job (like
  `arr_items`); full list on the Problems page ("In *arr, not in <server>",
  largest-first with sizes); Settings → Match health shows only summary counts +
  a link there. (`mediaMissingExternalIds()` reports the inverse:
  Plex items with a null `guid_tvdb`/`guid_tmdb` that can never match.) Matched via
  `media_items.guid_tvdb`/`guid_tmdb` (indexed). `size_bytes` + `instance_id`
  (scopes the per-instance replace) + `folder_name` (disk-orphan known-name set —
  an *arr title invisible to the media server still occupies disk) + `path`
  (the full *arr-side folder path, shown as the category's Location cell) added
  via guarded `ALTER`s. **FORK:** `arr_id` + `title_slug` too — a row used to be
  a report with no way to act on it; the series/movie id is what lets the
  Problems page rescan the title or remove a record whose folder is gone
  (`lib/source-actions.ts`).
- `arr_conflicts` — *arr claim collisions: during the `arr` job the
  first record to claim a rating_key wins `arr_items`; each later claimant is
  recorded here (winner `first_*` cols + loser `source/instance_*` cols + the
  loser's `size_on_disk`). TWO flavors, distinguished by `getArrConflicts()`'s
  computed `sameInstance` flag: cross-instance (two instances manage one title
  — remove it from one) and SAME-instance (two titles of one instance resolve
  to one media item — usually a merged multi-part entry in Plex carrying both
  ids, e.g. a two-part film; the fix is splitting the item apart in Plex, and
  the UI badges it that way). Replaced per-instance like `arr_unmatched` (rows are
  scoped to the LOSER's `instance_id`; failed instances keep their rows). Only
  observable in a run where both claimants were fetched — transient, self-healing.
  Surfaced on the admin Problems page.
- `disk_orphans` — the `diskScan` job's results: top-level entries under mapped
  library paths that neither the media server nor Sonarr/Radarr account for
  (matched by NAME per root — absolute paths differ across containers). Rebuilt
  per-section per run; sections the scan skips (safety guard: mostly-unnamed
  items; unreadable root) keep their prior rows. `mtime` keys the size cache
  (unchanged orphans aren't re-walked); `size_skipped=1` marks circuit-breaker
  rows (most of a root looked orphaned → suspect mapping → sizing skipped).
  Surfaced as the Problems page "On disk, in neither" category.
- `scheduled_deletions` — **FORK-ONLY** (crosses upstream's "never deletes"
  line): one row per tagged item (`rating_key` PK), `tagged_by`/`tagged_at`,
  `delete_after` (epoch), `status` (`pending`|`held`|`deleted`|`failed`|
  `cancelled`) + `status_at`/`status_detail`. The nightly `purge` job deletes
  eligible items **via Sonarr/Radarr only** (never the filesystem). Protective
  keeps always win: `applyKeep` flips a pending tag to `held`;
  `refreshDeletionHolds()` (run at the start of each purge) reconciles both
  directions; `dueDeletions()` re-checks `NOT EXISTS keep`. Unmatched items are
  reported, never deleted. Master toggle default OFF, dry-run default ON.
  `notified_week` flags the "entering final 7 days" Discord notice (guarded
  ALTER for fork DBs that predate it; marked only when actually delivered so
  a transient webhook failure retries nightly). `verified_at`/`residue_bytes`
  are the POST-DELETE reality check (`lib/purge-verify.ts`): *arr reporting
  success doesn't mean the folder is empty, so the purge re-measures it —
  `residue_bytes` NULL = couldn't verify (section unmapped/root unreadable,
  never read as "gone"), 0 = really gone, >0 = bytes left behind. The run
  summary reports MEASURED freed bytes, not the media server's assumed
  `size_bytes`; `deletionResidueItems()` lists the shortfall. The purge job also sends a
  Discord purge summary (live mode only) and then mirrors the pending set
  into the "Leaving Soon" Jellyfin/Emby collection (`lib/leaving-soon.ts` —
  Plex has no equivalent; collection add/remove lives in `lib/jellyfin.ts`).
  Manual tags and rule batches notify via `lib/discord.ts` (fire-and-forget,
  never breaks a job/route; no-op without a webhook URL).
- `deletion_rules` — **FORK-ONLY**: auto-tag rules (`name`, `enabled`,
  `conditions` JSON `RuleCondition[]` from `lib/types.ts`, `grace_days`
  override). The nightly `rules` job (02:00, `lib/rules.ts`) evaluates enabled
  rules via `ratingKeysMatchingRule()` — condition vocabulary:
  `last_watched_any`/`added_at` (olderThanDays), `size` (gt/ltGB), `library`
  (in), `requested` (eq), and **(3.2)** `verdict_score` (gte/lte, signed),
  `verdict_count` (gte/lte + a `verdict`), `verdict_by` (a user id + a
  `verdict`), `min_voters` (gte), `nobody_kept` (eq true only) — AND'd on a
  fixed baseline that excludes kept items and any item carrying a **LIVE**
  (`pending`/`held`) `scheduled_deletions` row — a countdown in progress, or a
  manual tag's chosen date, is never disturbed. **A FINISHED row does not block
  (policy set 2026-07-31, `RULE_TAGGED_EXPR`):** it used to be any row of any
  status, which made one cancel exempt a title from every future rule forever.
  Cancelling means "not this time"; **keeping** is the permanent protection, and
  no rule can override a keep. So `cancelled`/`failed`/`deleted` rows are
  re-taggable and `insertRuleTags` upserts over them (`ON CONFLICT … WHERE
  status NOT IN ('pending','held')` — the WHERE is what protects live rows),
  resetting `verified_at`/`residue_bytes`/`notified_week` and writing
  `status_detail = 'Re-tagged; previous outcome: <old status>'` so the deletion
  history still shows the title had been cancelled before. Matches are tagged
  `pending`, `tagged_by = 'rule:<id>'`. Inert unless `deletion_enabled`.
  Deleting a rule cancels its live tags (`cancelDeletionsByTagger`); disabling
  it leaves them counting down.
  **FORK (3.2) voter quorum.** A rule using ANY `VOTE_RULE_FIELDS` condition
  needs `DEFAULT_MIN_VOTERS` (2) distinct voters per item before it may tag —
  one person's swiping spree can't schedule the library. It's a default, not a
  floor: `min_voters` overrides it (1 = "one clear no is enough"), and rules are
  admin-only so the override is already gated. `effectiveMinVoters()` in
  `lib/types.ts` is the ONE place that decides — the SQL, the preview and the
  builder's "needs at least N different people" line all call it, so the number
  shown is the number that runs. Rules with no vote condition get no quorum
  (a size rule must not wait for votes it never reads). The vote conditions
  read the same `VOTES_CTE`/`ITEM_SCORES_CTE` as Browse and consensus, so an
  "OK to delete" made in Browse counts as a `done_with_it` vote for
  `verdict_by`. `min_voters`/`nobody_kept` emit no per-item SQL (the quorum is
  applied once; the keep exclusion is already baseline). Preview
  (`/api/admin/deletion-rules/preview`) returns `minVoters` +
  `heldByQuorum`/`excludedKept`/`excludedTagged` (`ruleExclusionCounts()` — ONE
  pass, reasons assigned with fixed precedence kept→tagged→quorum so the four
  buckets partition the condition matches exactly). This exists because **the
  same filter in Browse always lists more**: Browse applies none of the rule
  baseline, so it shows kept titles and titles already counting down
  (`excludedTagged` counts LIVE tags only). `ruleConditionSql()` is the shared
  conditions-only builder behind both; it is deliberately NOT exported —
  conditions without the baseline must never reach anything that tags, and
  `ruleExclusionCounts` returns counts only for the same reason.
- `verdicts` — **FORK-ONLY**: per-user swipe verdicts, PK
  `(plex_user_id, rating_key)`. Values: `want_to_watch`/`loved_it` (imply a
  keep), `dont_care` (maps to `user_skips`), `done_with_it`/`not_interested`
  (clear this user's keep; stand as delete votes). `applyVerdict` writes
  through atomically (keep-implying verdicts also pause a pending scheduled
  deletion, like `applyKeep`); `removeVerdict` (undo) reverses the write-
  through. The deck (`getSwipeDeck`) covers movies AND whole series (rows are
  series-level; UI up-swipe label is "Worth keeping" — stored value stays
  `loved_it`), is feed-eligible, excludes this user's verdicts, honors the
  `watch=` list modes. UI:
  `app/swipe/deck/page.tsx` → `components/SwipeView.tsx` (pointer-event card
  stack, no animation dep; arrows/S/U keys; 5-deep client undo buffer;
  `?section=&watch=` scope it — an unknown section id is ignored, not empty);
  rail entry "Swipe" + PWA shortcuts (Swipe → the deck, Movie night → the
  landing page). **(3.8)** `/swipe` itself is the **landing page**
  (`app/swipe/page.tsx` → `components/SwipeHome.tsx`): the library/list choice
  with its remaining count, the room entry (start/join, lifted out of Matches),
  and a peek at the top Movie night matches + highest-scoring "wanted gone"
  titles. `keeparr.swipeSkipLanding` sends returning swipers straight to
  `/swipe/deck`; `?home=1` always renders the landing page, so the deck's
  "Swipe home" link can't bounce. Labels + the localStorage keys live in
  `components/swipe-prefs.ts` (shared by both screens). Results at `/swipe/matches`
  (`components/MatchesView.tsx`): **Movie night** (`movieNightMatches` — ≥2
  chosen users with `want_to_watch`, optional nobody-watched filter, names
  deliberately visible) + **Consensus** (`verdictConsensus` — per-item name
  rollup by verdict, `delete_votes` = done_with_it + not_interested, sortable
  votes/size/**score**, filterable by voter+verdict) via
  `GET /api/swipe/matches` + `GET /api/swipe/consensus`.
  **Weighted scoring (3.3):** `VERDICT_POINTS` in `lib/types.ts` is the single
  scale (not_interested +2, done_with_it +1, dont_care 0, want_to_watch −1,
  loved_it −2; positive = the household wants it gone) — SQL builds its CASE
  from it via `verdictPointsSql`, so query and UI can't drift. A keep /
  "don't care" / "OK to delete" made OUTSIDE Swipe counts as an **implied**
  vote (`IMPLIED_VERDICTS`, the `VOTES_CTE` UNION in `lib/queries.ts`), so a
  Browse-only triager isn't scored 0 against a swiper's ±2; an explicit verdict
  always wins for that (user, item), and the three source tables are mutually
  exclusive per user, so nobody is counted twice. Implied names come back in
  separate `*_implicit_*` columns and are marked in the UI — "Bob (kept)" must
  never read as "Bob swiped it". `consensusVoters()` backs the voter filter.
  **Card verdict control (3.6):** on Browse (grid AND list) and Search, the
  5-state cycle REPLACES click-to-keep and the "I don't care" button —
  `MediaCard`/`MediaRow` take a `verdictControl` prop and read this user's
  keep/skip state from `useVerdictCycle` instead of `useKeepState` (applyVerdict
  writes both through). Order is `VERDICT_CYCLE` (score order, `null` first);
  shift-click or right-click steps BACK; writes are debounced so only the state
  you land on is sent (`components/useVerdictCycle.ts` — desired-vs-confirmed
  refs, so a click mid-request is never lost and a failure reverts to what the
  server acked). Labels/colours/glyphs live in `components/verdict-meta.ts`,
  shared with SwipeView. The **Keep page keeps its own keep/skip loop** (it's a
  batch triage screen) — its keeps still count, as implied votes.
  Browse cards additionally get an admin-only Schedule/Cancel-deletion button
  (`MediaCard taggable` prop, gated on `isAdmin && deletion_enabled`, calls
  the scheduled-deletions admin API with the configured grace). Cards show OMDb enrichment when present:
  `media_items` gained `imdb_rating`/`rt_score`/`metacritic`/
  `ratings_fetched_at` (guarded ALTERs, keyed by the existing `guid_imdb` —
  first id when CSV). The daily `ratings` job (09:00, `lib/ratings.ts` over
  `lib/omdb.ts`) backfills under a ~900/day cap with a natural resume cursor
  (never-fetched first), stamps misses so they aren't refetched, refreshes
  >90d-stale entries, and aborts the run on transport/auth errors. OMDb key:
  `omdb_api_key`* (Settings → General "Ratings (OMDb)" card; test via
  `test-connection` service `omdb`; job gated in health checks on
  `isOmdbConfigured`). Cards also show **backend enrichment** (synopsis / genres /
  runtime): `media_items` gained `overview`/`genres` (JSON label array)/
  `runtime_minutes` (CREATE block **and** guarded ALTERs, same fresh-db-build-race
  reason as the ratings columns). Filled by the normal library/recentlyAdded sync
  through the `lib/mediaserver/*` seam — `BackendItem` carries `overview`/`genres`/
  `runtimeMinutes` (Plex `summary`/`Genre[].tag`/`duration`; Jellyfin `Overview`/
  `Genres`/`RunTimeTicks`), no new job. `toCard` (`lib/cards.ts`, via `parseGenres`)
  surfaces them on every card DTO; rendered on the swipe card (`components/SwipeView.tsx`).
- `swipe_rooms` / `swipe_room_members` / `swipe_room_votes` — **FORK-ONLY**: live
  "movie night" swipe rooms. A group joins by `code`, swipes the **same** ordered
  deck, and the room lands on the first title EVERYONE currently present swipes
  "want to watch". Transport is **short polling** (~2s; no websockets/deps) —
  `swipe_room_members.last_seen` is presence, bumped by each poll; a member idle
  past `ACTIVE_WINDOW_SEC` (25s, `lib/rooms.ts`) stops counting toward (or
  blocking) a match. `swipe_room_votes` is one `want`/pass per (room,user,item) —
  only wants complete a match; passes just advance that user's deck. Match logic
  (`computeRoomMatch` → first title with a want from every active member, ≥2
  present, earliest-completed) is committed atomically by `setRoomMatched` (only
  the first caller wins, so concurrent pollers don't double-fire). Rooms are
  DB-backed (survive the restart every push ships); `pruneStaleRooms` closes rooms
  older than `ROOM_TTL_SEC` (12h) on create. Orchestration + code generation +
  `RoomState` assembly live in `lib/rooms.ts` (`createUniqueRoom`, `evaluateMatch`,
  `buildRoomState`); all SQL in `lib/queries.ts`. UI: `components/RoomView.tsx`
  (a `/swipe/rooms/[code]` page — poll loop, binary want/pass card stack, live
  roster, match celebration); entry (Start a room / Join by code) on
  `components/MatchesView.tsx`.
- `settings` — key/value; secret values encrypted.
- `job_state` — one row per scheduled job (`recentlyAdded`/`library`/`sizes`/`watch`/
  `requests`/`arr`/`diskScan`/`backup`): last run/status/message/duration/result. Rows stuck at
  `running` (process killed mid-job) are flipped to `error` at boot by
  `startScheduler()` → `resetInterruptedJobs()` — the persisted flag would
  otherwise gate that job out of the scheduler AND manual runs forever.
- `job_runs` — append-only run history (last ~100) for the admin activity log.
- `logs` — app-event log (`ts,level,source,message`, pruned to ~1000) for Settings → Logs.
- `sync_state` — legacy single row (id=1); superseded by `job_state`, no longer read.

The shared id across Plex/Tautulli/Seerr is the Plex **ratingKey** (mutable
across Plex library rebuilds — treat as best-effort). Sonarr/Radarr instead match
on the **stable** external ids `guid_tvdb` (shows) / `guid_tmdb` (movies) / `guid_imdb`
(both — the extra axis), which Plex sync populates. Matching tries the primary id
(tvdb/tmdb) then falls back to **imdb** (`ArrRecord.imdbId`; both Sonarr & Radarr expose
`imdbId`) — so an item Plex only matched to IMDb still resolves. **A Plex item can carry
MULTIPLE ids of a kind** (e.g. a show merged across two TheTVDB entries), so
`extractGuids` keeps ALL of them as a CSV (`"376459,407505"`) and `ratingKeysByGuid`
splits it so an arr id matching ANY of them resolves. (`ratingKeysByGuid('imdb')` spans
both kinds; `tvdb`/`tmdb` stay kind-scoped.) Keeping only one — the old behavior took the
last — meant items matched the wrong id and showed as unmatched even though the right id
was present. `extractGuids` also falls back to the legacy single-`guid` string
(`com.plexapp.agents.thetvdb://…`, `…imdb://tt…`) when the modern `Guid[]` array is absent.
`mediaMissingExternalIds` (the "can never match" count) treats an item as id-less only
when it has no tvdb/tmdb **and** no imdb.

## API routes

- **Auth is backend-aware** (`media_server_type`): Plex uses PIN OAuth; Jellyfin/Emby
  use username+password. `POST /api/auth/plex/pin` → `{id, authUrl}`; `GET
  /api/auth/plex/check?id=` → `{status: pending|authorized|denied, needsSetup, isAdmin}`
  (Plex). `POST /api/auth/setup {type, url?}` — first-run only (403 once an admin exists):
  records the chosen server type, and for Jellyfin/Emby tests+stores the server URL.
  `POST /api/auth/login {username, password}` — Jellyfin/Emby credential login (a
  successful auth IS server access; first user bootstraps owner and their access token
  becomes the server read token). `POST /api/auth/logout` (clear this device's
  cookie); `POST /api/auth/logout-all` (bump the user's `session_epoch` →
  invalidate every token they hold, then clear the cookie — "sign out all
  devices"); `GET /api/auth/me`. The Plex PIN create/poll endpoints
  (`/api/auth/plex/pin`, `/api/auth/plex/check`) and the credential
  `/api/auth/login` are per-IP rate-limited (`lib/rate-limit.ts`); login also
  buckets per-username + globally so `X-Forwarded-For` rotation can't bypass it.
- `GET /api/feed/random?limit=&section=&largest=1&watch=` → home batch. Default
  (no params) = screen-fill mix across **all Plex libraries**, weighted toward big
  series with a guaranteed few movies. `section=<id>` limits to one Plex library;
  `largest=1` = biggest titles regardless of library/keep-eligibility
  (`remaining` is null). `watch=` restricts to a watch-history list
  (`never_played`/`stale_90`/`recent_30` = anyone's history, `my_unwatched` =
  this user's; ignored with `largest=1`; `remaining` counts within the list).
  The Keep page shows the list tabs only when watch data is available
  (`isWatchAvailable()`). Categories are real Plex libraries — never hardcoded.
- **FORK:** `GET /api/swipe/deck?limit=&section=&watch=` → un-swiped movies +
  `remaining`; `POST /api/swipe/verdict {ratingKey, verdict}` (validated
  against `VERDICTS`; replaces a previous verdict, transitioning its
  write-through state) / `DELETE {ratingKey}` (undo → `{ok, removed}`). The
  card cycle control reuses these two — no new endpoint.
- **FORK:** `GET /api/swipe/consensus?sort=votes|size|score&voter=&verdict=&offset=`
  → `{items, me, voters[], hasMore, nextOffset}`. Items carry `score`/`voters`
  plus `keepImplicitNames`/`doneImplicitNames`/`skipImplicitCount` (opinions
  implied by a keep / "OK to delete" / "don't care" rather than a swipe).
  `voter`+`verdict` slice the list — "everything Alice let go" — without
  narrowing any row's rollup. Unknown sort/verdict values fall back to the
  default rather than erroring (it's a browse surface).
  **Per-item review (3.2 follow-up):** rows also carry `skipNames`/
  `skipImplicitNames` (a count is enough for a cell, not for "what did Sam
  say") and `scheduledDeleteAfter`/`scheduledDeleteHeld` from a LIVE-tag-only
  LEFT JOIN (`scheduled_deletions` is PK'd on rating_key so the join can't
  multiply rows and skew the vote counts). The UI expands a row into a
  who-said-what panel (`voteDetail()` in `MatchesView`, worst-first, implied
  opinions labelled with their source) and — for admins with deletion enabled
  (`canTagDeletion`, same gate as Browse) — a Schedule/Cancel button, so the
  decision happens where the evidence is. A kept item tags as `held`; the UI
  mirrors that from `r.kept` rather than claiming a live countdown.
- **FORK:** live "movie night" rooms (all `requireUser`, short-poll transport):
  `POST /api/swipe/rooms {section?, watch?}` → create + host-join → `{code, state}`;
  `POST /api/swipe/rooms/{code}/join` → `{state}`;
  `GET /api/swipe/rooms/{code}` → the **poll** (bumps presence, re-checks
  consensus, returns `{state}`; members only, 403 `not_in_room` / 404
  `room_not_found`); `GET /api/swipe/rooms/{code}/deck?limit=` → this viewer's
  shared-order slice + `remaining`; `POST /api/swipe/rooms/{code}/vote
  {ratingKey, want}` → record + re-evaluate → `{state}` (carries the matched card
  once the room agrees); `POST /api/swipe/rooms/{code}/leave` → `{ok}` (host
  leaving an open room closes it). `RoomState` = `{code, status, isHost,
  members[], activeCount, matched}`.
- `POST/DELETE /api/keep` `{ratingKey}` — toggle **this user's** keep. POST also
  clears their "don't care" + "OK to delete" (one transaction — the keep/skip/
  mark-delete POSTs each use an atomic `apply*` query, and all three 404 on an
  unknown OR tombstoned item via `getActiveMediaItem`); DELETE removes only
  their own keep (others' keeps stay, item remains protected).
- `POST/DELETE /api/skip` `{ratingKey}` — per-user single-item "don't care"
  toggle. POST also clears this user's keep + "OK to delete" (mutually exclusive).
- `POST/DELETE /api/mark-delete` `{ratingKey}` — per-user "OK to delete" toggle.
  POST is **gated** by `isRequestedByUser` (403 `not_requested` otherwise) and clears
  this user's keep + "don't care". Does not touch others' keeps.
- `POST /api/skip-batch` `{ratingKeys[]}` — per-user skip + fresh batch (keep-loop).
  Enforces the same exclusivity server-side (`applySkipBatch` clears the user's
  keep/OK-to-delete on the batch, drops unknown/tombstoned keys); non-array →
  400 `bad_request`, >500 keys → 400 `too_many_items`.
- `GET /api/library?sections=<id,id,…>&q=&sort=size|title|added|year|library|quality|tags|status|watched|score&dir=asc|desc&minScore=<n>&state=keptByMe,keptOther,dontcare,okDeleteMine,okDeleteAny,undecided&kept=all|kept|unkept&keptByMe=1&skip=all|skipped|unskipped&deleted=all|deletedByMe|deletedAny&watch=all|watched|unwatched|unwatchedAny|recent30|recent60|recent90|stale90&source=sonarr|radarr&instance=&tag=&quality=&monitored=monitored,unmonitored&requestedByMe=1&hideKept=&offset=`
  — browse/search; `sections` is a comma list of Plex library ids (omit = all,
  multi-select in the sidebar). Returns `kept` (anyone), per-user `keptByMe`,
  per-user `skipped`, per-user `watched`, per-user `requestedByMe` +
  `markedForDeleteByMe`, server-wide `markedForDeleteAny` (no identity),
  **and Sonarr/Radarr metadata** (`source`,
  `instanceName`, `monitored`, `status`, `quality`, `qualityKind`, `tags[]` — null
  when the title isn't arr-matched; powers Browse's List view + quality badge). The
  Browse UI exposes a **Status** filter as a **combinable checkbox dropdown** →
  the `state=` param: a comma list of per-user decision buckets OR'd together
  (**empty = All**). Buckets: `keptByMe` (you keep it), `keptOther` (kept by
  someone else, not you), `dontcare` (your "don't care"), `undecided` (you've made
  no keep/skip/delete decision — excludes only YOUR own marks; **FORK:** your
  own verdict counts as a decision too, since the delete-side ones write no
  keep/skip/delete row and the view would otherwise never drain — deliberately
  NOT mirrored in `librarySummary`, whose three buckets must partition the
  bytes exactly), and — only when
  Seerr is connected — `okDeleteMine` / `okDeleteAny` (your / anyone's "OK to
  delete", the by-anyone view stays identity-free). Defaults to `state=undecided`
  (hides items you've decided on). (The legacy single-select `kept`/`keptByMe`/
  `skip`/`deleted` params are still honored for back-compat but the Browse UI now
  drives `state`.) Also a **Grid/List** view toggle (remembered in
  `localStorage`; List adds
  click-to-sort column headers — all columns, sort persisted — and a poster column),
  — **only when watch data is available** (`isWatchAvailable()`: Tautulli for
  Plex, native for Jellyfin/Emby) — a **Watched** filter (`watch=`):
  watched/not-watched **by you**, **not watched by anyone** (`unwatchedAny`,
  server-wide), recency windows, `stale90`; — **only when Sonarr/Radarr is
  connected** — **multi-select** `source`/`instance`/`tag`/`quality`/`status`/
  `monitored` filters (each a comma-separated "any of"; empty = no filter; the
  quality dropdown groups values by resolution bucket with select-all), a **`match`**
  filter (`matched`/`unmatched` — In vs Not in Sonarr·Radarr), and a `sizeMismatch=1`
  toggle (Plex vs arr size diverges >10% AND >1 GB); and `requestedByMe` (Seerr).
  Items also carry `arrSizeBytes` + a computed `sizeMismatch` flag. (The arr
  multi-value filters restrict to arr-matched titles; `match`/`sizeMismatch` don't.)
- `GET /api/library/facets` → `{instances,tags,qualities,statuses}` for the Browse
  arr filter dropdowns (from `arrFacets()`).
- `GET /api/search?q=&offset=` → ranked results (exact>prefix>word>substring,
  multi-token AND), with kept + per-user skipped/watched/requestedByMe +
  markedForDeleteByMe/markedForDeleteAny flags (so search cards show the "OK to
  delete" control too). `GET /api/search/suggest?q=` → top-8 typeahead.
- `GET /api/sections` → managed libraries `[{id,title,kind,itemCount,sizeBytes}]`
  (nav rail Browse, Keep filters, Library, Big Picture).
- `GET /api/storage` → per-filesystem free/total (`fs.statfs`) + per-library used
  size; `configured:false` until libraries are mapped to disk paths.
- `GET /api/overview` → per-library, per-user keep breakdown + disk capacity, in
  one call (powers the Keep totals column and the Big Picture dashboard). Each
  library partitions its bytes/items into `kept` (protected — anyone keeps it),
  `dontcare` (not protected + this user skipped), and `undecided` (the rest);
  `keptByMe*` is a sub-count of kept. Also returns `unwatched*` (items NOBODY on the
  server has watched — the Big Picture "never watched" reclaim metric) plus
  `unwatchedKeptBytes`/`unwatchedKeptByMeBytes`/`unwatchedDontcareBytes`/
  `unwatchedUndecidedBytes` (the never-watched bytes split by keep bucket, so the
  metric can be drawn as a subset of the composition bar — surfacing e.g. kept
  titles nobody has watched), `storage` totals, `mediaUsedBytes`, summed `totals`,
  `tautulli` (bool — whether watch surfaces should render), and — when Sonarr/Radarr
  is connected — `arr: true` + `qualityBreakdown` (`{byQuality[], notInArr}` → the
  Big Picture "By quality" table; its `reclaimableBytes` field shows in the UI as
  "Not kept"); and — when Seerr is connected — `seerr: true` + `markedForDelete:
  {titles, bytes}` (the Big Picture "OK to delete" KPI). Backed by `librarySummary` +
  `arrQualitySummary`/`unmatchedMediaSummary` + `markedForDeleteSummary`.
- `GET /api/about` → `{name, version, latest, updateAvailable, releaseUrl}` for the
  About panel (latest = newest GitHub release via `lib/version.ts`, cached ~6h;
  null when unknown/offline — never an error).
- `GET /api/openapi.json` — the OpenAPI spec (authored at repo-root
  `openapi.json`; keep it in sync when routes change). Rendered at `/api-docs`.
- `GET /api/stats?view=largest|reclaimable|unwatched|markedForDelete&offset=` — big
  picture + summary. `unwatched` = largest titles nobody has watched
  (`neverWatchedItems`; the "Never watched" drill-down, shown only when watch data
  is available — Tautulli for Plex, native for Jellyfin/Emby).
  `markedForDelete` = titles anyone marked "OK to delete", largest first,
  each with its marker name(s) + a `keptByAnyone` flag (`markedForDeleteItems`; the
  drill-down shown only when Seerr is connected — the one place marker identity is
  shown). Accepts a session user **or** the API key (`X-Api-Key`).
- `GET /api/requests` — current user's Seerr rating keys for badges, read from the
  `seerr_requests` cache (refreshed by the `requests` job, not live).
- `GET /api/image?path=&w=&h=` — proxies posters (token stays server-side); backend-aware
  (`path` = Plex relative thumb, or a Jellyfin/Emby item id → `/Items/{id}/Images/Primary`).
- `GET /api/health` — public liveness probe (used by the Docker healthcheck).
- Admin (require `is_admin`): `GET/PUT /api/admin/settings` (PUT accepts
  `storageMappings`, `managedSectionIds`, `appTitle`, `appUrl`, `apiKey`, `plexBaseUrl`,
  `jobSchedules`, `plexServer`, `tautulli`, `seerr`, `sonarrInstances`,
  `radarrInstances`, `backupRetention` — GET returns instances as `[{id,name,url,hasKey}]`, never their
  apiKeys; the automation `apiKey` IS returned so the UI can show a masked
  copy-able field, Servarr-style),
  `GET /api/admin/plex-servers`, `POST /api/admin/test-connection` (services
  `plex`/`jellyfin`/`emby`/`tautulli`/`seerr`/`sonarr`/`radarr`),
  `POST /api/admin/sync-libraries` (discover sections only, fast — backend-agnostic
  via `getBackend().listSections()`),
  `GET /api/admin/storage-check?path=`, `GET /api/admin/jobs` (status + recent runs)
  + `POST /api/admin/jobs {job}` (trigger one/`all`) — both also accept `X-Api-Key`,
  `GET /api/admin/logs?level=&q=&limit=` (keyword search over message+source;
  limit ≤ 1000 for the .txt export) + `DELETE /api/admin/logs`,
  `GET /api/admin/cache` + `POST /api/admin/cache {target:images|requests|watch|arr}`

  filters kind via extKind; diskOrphans sections only; arrConflicts none);
  categories:
  `sizeMismatch|notInArr|missingFromPlex|identityMismatch|duplicates|arrConflicts|`
  `zeroSize|removedButKept|missingIds|diskOrphans`; NO default view:
  missing/unknown type
  → 400 `unknown_type`, arr-gated type without arr → 400 `arr_not_configured`,
  `diskOrphans` without mappings → 400 `storage_not_configured`; returns
  `{type, items, hasMore, nextOffset}`, item shape varies per category —
  `duplicates` items are groups, `identityMismatch` items pair `{media, arr}`
  claims on one folder, `diskOrphans` items are filesystem entries
  `{name, sectionId, path, isDir, sizeBytes, sizeSkipped, likely}` (`likely` =
  the library title the orphan looks like — usually a leftover copy);
  diagnosis fields: `sizeMismatch` rows carry `diskSizeBytes/diskCheckedAt`
  (measured tiebreaker) + `fileCount` (movies; >1 = merged multi-part item, the
  mismatch is by design → badge "likely fine"), `missingFromPlex` rows carry
  `onDisk/diskSizeBytes`
  (reality check) + `claimedByTitle`, `notInArr` rows carry `identityArrTitle`
  (both = "this row is half of an identity-mismatch pair — fix the match
  there"), `identityMismatch` rows carry the media side's own
  `guidTmdb/guidTvdb/guidImdb` (rendered beside the *arr's id so the
  disagreement is visible), `arrConflicts` rows carry `sameInstance` (+
  `instanceId` on winner/loser; true = two titles of ONE instance resolve to
  one item — merged multi-part entry → badge "split apart in Plex"),
  `zeroSize` rows carry `arrBytes/instanceName` (*arr context: the
  server sees no files but the *arr has N GB). Every table's last column is a
  **"What to do" ActionBadge** (client-derived from these fields; amber = fix
  needed, slate = informational/judgment). Zero-size items are EXCLUDED from
  sizeMismatch (SIZE_MISMATCH_EXPR requires size_bytes > 0 — affects the
  Browse filter identically, by design); they carry their diagnosis in
  zeroSize instead. Categories are ordered/grouped into three families
  (server↔*arr / within-server / on-disk; PILL_GROUPS in ProblemsView renders
  labeled clusters); media-item rows
  carry `dirPath` (full server-side folder path; `path` on missingFromPlex) →
  the UI's Location cells: tail display, full path on hover, click-to-copy,
  and duplicates dim the group's common prefix so the differing folder pops),
  `GET/PUT /api/admin/users` (list + grant/revoke admin + enable/disable + the
  `openSignin` toggle; Owner can't be demoted or disabled),
  `POST /api/admin/users/import` (import the Plex shared-user list),
  **FORK:** `GET/POST/DELETE /api/admin/scheduled-deletions` (list / tag
  `{ratingKey, graceDays?}` **or `{ratingKeys[], graceDays?}`** / cancel
  `{ratingKey}` — POST tags `held` when
  anyone currently keeps the item; DELETE keeps the row as `cancelled` for
  audit). The batch form (≤200 keys, → `{ok, deleteAfter, tagged, skipped}`)
  backs the Problems tag picker: one shared deadline, ONE Discord summary
  instead of N pings (like the rules job), and a dead id costs only itself
  (`skipped`) instead of failing the batch. The single-key form keeps its exact
  old contract, 404 included. GET is the **deletion audit trail** behind `/deletions`: rows carry
  `verifiedAt`/`residueBytes` (null = the disk couldn't be checked — never read
  as "gone"), plus a per-status `summary`, a `reclaim` rollup that measures
  freed bytes across VERIFIED deletions only, and `residueItems`
  (`deletionResidueItems()` — reported deleted, bytes still on disk). Browse's Status filter gains a `scheduledDeletion` bucket (shown only
  when the Deletion toggle is on) and library rows carry
  `scheduledDeleteAfter`/`scheduledDeleteHeld` → the card badge.
  **FORK:** `/api/library` and `/api/search` rows also carry `myVerdict` (this
  user's swipe verdict, from a `verdicts` LEFT JOIN) — the cycle control needs
  its current position, not just the derived keep/skip flags.
  **FORK (3.2): Browse by household score.** `/api/library` rows carry
  `verdictScore`/`verdictVoters` (both absent when nobody voted — an absent
  score is NOT a 0), gained `sort=score` and a `minScore=<n>` threshold.
  Computed in `queryLibrary` from `ITEM_SCORES_CTE` over the same `VOTES_CTE`
  the consensus screen uses, so one title can't score differently on the two
  screens; un-voted rows sort last in BOTH directions (`vs.score` is NULL, not
  0) while `minScore` treats them as 0, so a threshold of 0 or less is not a
  filter. UI: a "Household score" sort option (grid) + sortable Score column
  (list) + a "Score ≥ +N" dropdown, rendered by `components/ScoreBadge.tsx` on
  cards and rows. Search is deliberately NOT scored — `SearchRow.score` is
  already relevance.
  **FORK:** `POST /api/admin/problem-actions`
  `{action, ratingKeys?, unmatchedKeys?}` →
  `{ok, message, changed}` — the Problems page's fix-it actions. Deliberately a
  SEPARATE route from upstream's `/api/admin/problems/*` reads so fork actions
  never collide on a sync. TWO families.
  **Source actions (act in the app that owns the title, ≤100 rows each, at
  least one key required — see `lib/source-actions.ts`):** `arr-rescan` /
  `arr-refresh` (Sonarr·Radarr Rescan/Refresh commands), `server-rescan` /
  `server-reidentify` (Jellyfin/Emby `POST /Items/{id}/Refresh`; re-identify =
  FullRefresh + replaceAllMetadata, which is what repopulates the tmdb/tvdb ids
  *arr matching runs on), `arr-remove-stale` (DELETE the *arr record with
  `deleteFiles=false`, ONLY for `arr_unmatched` rows with `on_disk = 0` — the
  gate is re-read from the DB, never trusted from the body; the local row is
  dropped on success so the table stops listing a title that no longer exists).
  All of them answer `changed: 0` when the work is queued upstream, so the UI
  doesn't refetch and show identical rows. `GET` on the same route returns
  `{links}` — where each selected row can be opened in Sonarr/Radarr (by
  `title_slug`) or on the media server — resolved server-side because those URLs
  are admin-only settings.
  **Keeparr-side:** `relink` runs `relinkReplacedItems()` on demand (the
  "don't wait for the 03:00 library sweep" button, offered on `removedButKept`);
  `rescan` calls `triggerServerRefresh()` so the server drops entries whose
  files are gone (offered on `zeroSize`/`missingFromPlex`); `diskscan` fires the
  weekly `diskScan` job on demand (offered on `sizeMismatch` — the measured size
  is the tiebreaker the table already tells you to go get — and on
  `diskOrphans`), fire-and-forget like `/api/admin/jobs`, always
  `changed: 0` since the job is still walking when the response returns.
  Nothing in either family deletes media or touches the filesystem.
  UI: `components/ForkProblemActions.tsx`, an action bar above the table.
  Upstream's `ProblemsView.tsx` gets exactly ONE line (plus the import) — its
  per-category switch and ~23 inline action-badge sites are hot upstream code,
  so no fork markup goes in there. That constraint is why the **tag picker**
  (Schedule deletion for rows you select) is a fork-owned panel in the action
  bar rather than a per-row button: a trailing cell would mean ~10 insertions
  into the hottest part of upstream's file. The bar reads `items` (the same one
  line) and maps them per category via `CANDIDATES` — only `notInArr`,
  `missingIds`, `zeroSize` (sized by `arrBytes`: the *arr is what deletes) and
  `duplicates` (flattened to individual copies, labelled by folder). NOT
  `missingFromPlex`/`diskOrphans` (not media items — no id, and the filesystem
  is off-limits), NOT `removedButKept` (tombstoned, so `tagForDeletion` would
  fail), and NOT `sizeMismatch`/`identityMismatch`/`arrConflicts` (the fix
  there is a rescan or a match correction). The **source picker** ("Fix at the
  source…") is the same fork-owned panel for the same reason, over
  `SOURCE_FIXES` (which actions a category gets) + `SOURCE_CANDIDATES` (how to
  read its differently-shaped rows). A candidate can carry BOTH ends —
  `identityMismatch` is one media item disagreeing with one *arr record, and the
  two fixes act on opposite sides — so the picker collects `ratingKeys` and
  `unmatchedKeys` separately from one selection. `arrConflicts` and
  `diskOrphans` are deliberately absent (the fix is a human choice between two
  instances, or the filesystem). It reads `deletion.enabled`, the *arr instance
  count and `mediaServerType` from `/api/admin/settings` itself rather than
  threading props through upstream — the last one hides the per-item server
  actions on Plex, which has no equivalent call.
  **FORK:** `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/deletion-rules` (rule CRUD;
  conditions validated by `parseRuleConditions`) +
  `POST /api/admin/deletion-rules/preview` `{conditions}` →
  `{count, totalBytes, sample[], minVoters, heldByQuorum}` (what tonight's run
  would tag, plus the 3.2 quorum and what it held back). UI: the
  "Deletion rules" card (`components/settings/DeletionRulesCard.tsx`) in
  Settings → General — the builder shows the effective quorum while you edit
  and names verdicts via `components/verdict-meta.ts` (one vocabulary with
  Swipe and the card cycle).

## Settings keys (all via `lib/settings.ts`)

`media_server_type` (`'plex'|'jellyfin'|'emby'`; **defaults to `'plex'`** when unset, so
existing installs are unchanged — chosen once at first-run setup), `media_device_id`
(stable id for the Jellyfin/Emby MediaBrowser auth header). Per-backend connection keys
resolve through type-aware accessors (`getServerBaseUrl/Token/Name/Id`, `getOwnerId`,
`getAdminToken`, `isServerConfigured`): Plex keeps its historical names —
`plex_client_id`, `plex_owner_id`, `plex_admin_token`*, `plex_machine_id`,
`plex_base_url`, `plex_server_token`*, `plex_server_name`; Jellyfin/Emby use a uniform
scheme — `<type>_url`, `<type>_token`*, `<type>_admin_token`*, `<type>_server_id`,
`<type>_server_name`, `<type>_owner_id` (`<type>` = `jellyfin`|`emby`). `plex_sections` (json;
includes each section's `paths[]`; reused for all backends), `tautulli_url`, `tautulli_api_key`*,
`seerr_url`, `seerr_api_key`*, `sonarr_instances`*, `radarr_instances`* (json
arrays of `{id,name,url,apiKey}` — N instances each; the whole blob is encrypted),
`job_schedules` (json per job: `{type:'interval',minutes}`,
`{type:'daily',hour,minute}`, or `{type:'weekly',weekday,hour,minute}`; replaced
the legacy single `sync_interval_minutes`, which is no longer read),
`storage_mappings` (json `{sectionId,path}[]` — container paths for free-space
measurement), `managed_section_ids` (json; which libraries Keeparr tracks, empty =
all), `open_signin` (`'true'`/`'false'`), `api_key`* (automation), `app_title`,
`app_url` (Plex sign-in forwardUrl; overrides the `APP_URL` env var),
`backup_retention` (how many backup files to keep; default 14),
**FORK:** `deletion_enabled` (default `'false'` — master switch for the purge
job), `deletion_grace_days` (default 30), `deletion_dry_run` (default `'true'`
— purge only logs), `leaving_soon_enabled` (default `'true'` — mirror pending
tags into a "Leaving Soon" Jellyfin/Emby collection, `lib/leaving-soon.ts`;
cached collection id in `leaving_soon_collection_id`), `discord_webhook_url`*
(deletion notifications, `lib/discord.ts`; empty = off; all edited via the
Settings → General "Deletion" card; test via `test-connection` service
`discord`),
`dev_storage_total` (demo-only synthetic capacity, set by the seed). `*` = encrypted
at rest.

**Local demo mode**: `npm run seed` (`lib/dev-seed.ts` + `scripts/seed.mts`) fills
`./data` with fake libraries; `KEEPARR_DEV_LOGIN=1` makes `middleware.ts` auto-mint a
dev session (no Plex/login). `KEEPARR_DEV_SERVER=jellyfin|emby npm run seed` configures
the demo as that backend (fake connection) instead of Plex, so the setup/login branch +
backend-aware UI are clickable offline (default = Plex). All inert/absent in production.

## Auth / access control

- **Backend is selectable** (`media_server_type`, default `'plex'`). The login page
  (`app/login/page.tsx` server component → `LoginClient`) reads the type and renders the
  right flow; a server-type chooser appears only on a brand-new install (no type chosen +
  no admin). `decideAccess` (`lib/login.ts`) is backend-agnostic — it only takes booleans.
- **Plex** — PIN OAuth: create pin → user authorizes at app.plex.tv → poll → token →
  identity (`/api/v2/user`) → `decideAccess`. Other users must appear in the server's
  shared-users list (`checkServerAccess`, parsing `plex.tv/api/users` via `parseSharedUsers`).
- **Jellyfin/Emby** — credential login (`/api/auth/login` → `authenticateByName`): a
  successful auth IS server access (no shared-user list). The first-run flow collects the
  server URL via `/api/auth/setup` (bootstrap-only) before login; the bootstrap admin's
  access token becomes the server read token.
- First-ever login = **bootstrap_admin** (claims admin, stores owner id + token; for Plex
  must then connect a server). Owner is always allowed.
- Admin is **binary** (`users.is_admin`). Shared users log in with `is_admin=0`;
  any admin can promote/revoke others from the Users screen via `setUserAdmin`
  (the explicit counterpart to `upsertUser`, whose `MAX(is_admin, …)` only raises).
  The Owner (`plex_owner_id`) can never be demoted. There are **no local accounts**
  — Plex login only, no self-registration.
- **Sign-in gate**: `open_signin` (default on) lets any shared-server user in. When
  off, `decideAccess` admits non-owners only if they're `userKnown && userEnabled`
  (use **Import users from Plex** to pre-create accounts, then toggle Enabled).
  `getSessionUser` returns null for a disabled non-owner, so blocking takes effect
  immediately. The Owner is always allowed/enabled.
- **Security posture** (audited July 2026, hardened for CA listing): all SQL is
  parameterized (`lib/queries.ts`), every `/api/admin/*` route calls `requireAdmin`,
  secrets are AES-GCM encrypted at rest (`lib/crypto.ts` `SECRET_KEYS`). Hardening in
  place: the image proxy **requires auth** (`requireUserOrApiKey` — middleware's
  `X-Api-Key` passthrough only DEFERS validation, so every `/api/` route must guard
  itself) and validates `path` against an SSRF allowlist (`lib/image-path.ts
  isSafeImagePath` — Plex must be `/library/…`, no `://`/`..`; JF/Emby an opaque id),
  clamps `w`/`h`, and only serves `image/*`; `/api/auth/login` (Jellyfin/Emby creds) is
  rate-limited per IP **and per-username + globally** so `X-Forwarded-For` rotation
  can't bypass it (`lib/rate-limit.ts`), and the Plex PIN create/poll endpoints are
  per-IP capped; `/api/auth/setup` rejects non-http(s) URLs before its pre-auth probe;
  session tokens carry a per-user `session_epoch` so "sign out all devices" /
  admin-disable revoke outstanding tokens; all outbound `fetch`es have a 15s timeout;
  the API-key and session-signature compares are constant-time (`safeEqual`);
  `errorResponse` 500 bodies are bare `{error:'internal_error'}` (the raw
  exception text is logged, never sent — it can leak paths/hosts) and a
  malformed JSON body returns 400 `invalid_json`, not a 500;
  `instrumentation.ts` **fails closed** (throws) on a production boot with a missing/
  default `SESSION_SECRET` and warns on a short one. The Docker image runs the app as a
  non-root `PUID:PGID` (root only chowns `/data`, then drops via `su-exec`), strips
  npm/yarn/corepack from the runtime stage, pins the base image by digest, and `npm
  audit` is clean (postcss pinned via an `overrides` entry). CI/release pin every
  GitHub Action to a commit SHA (Dependabot keeps them fresh). Baseline response headers
  set in `next.config.js` (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `Referrer-Policy`, CSP `frame-ancestors 'self'`) — deliberately NO strict
  script/style CSP (would break the inline theme script + Scalar). Backup filenames
  are regex-validated (`isValidBackupName`); the image cache key is SHA-1-hashed before
  becoming a path. `KEEPARR_DEV_LOGIN` is the only auth bypass and is env-gated +
  `NODE_ENV`-guarded + inert in production (never set it in the image).
- **API key** (`api_key`): `requireAdminOrApiKey`/`requireUserOrApiKey` (`lib/auth.ts`)
  accept an `X-Api-Key` header as an alternative to a session (for `/api/admin/jobs`
  + `/api/stats`). `middleware.ts` lets `/api/` requests carrying that header past the
  edge session gate; the Node route validates the key.
- Server owner's account token (`plex_admin_token`) is used for shared-user
  checks + server discovery. The per-device server token (`plex_server_token`)
  is used for all PMS reads.

## External API notes (verified against Overseerr / python-plexapi / Tautulli)

- **Plex size on disk**: `MediaContainer.Metadata[].Media[].Part[].size` (bytes).
  Movies inline; series via `GET /library/metadata/{ratingKey}/allLeaves` summed
  over all episodes. Helpers: `sumPartSizes`, `sumLeafSizes`. `sumLeafSizes`
  dedupes by `Part.file`/`Part.id` so a **multi-episode file** (one file shared by
  several episode leaves — Plex reports the full size on each) is counted once,
  not once per episode.
- **Plex PIN**: `POST plex.tv/api/v2/pins?strong=true`, auth at
  `app.plex.tv/auth#?clientID=&code=&context[device][product]=`, poll
  `GET plex.tv/api/v2/pins/{id}` until `authToken`. Reuse a stable
  `X-Plex-Client-Identifier` (persisted as `plex_client_id`).
- **Jellyfin / Emby** (MediaBrowser API, verified against Seerr's `jellyfin.ts`): auth
  `POST /Users/AuthenticateByName {Username,Pw}` with the `MediaBrowser Client=…,
  Device=…, DeviceId=…, Version=…[, Token=…]` header (sent on both `Authorization` and
  `X-Emby-Authorization`; device id persisted as `media_device_id`) → `{AccessToken,
  User:{Id,Name,Policy.IsAdministrator}}`. Libraries `GET /Library/MediaFolders`
  (CollectionType movies→movie, tvshows→show). Items `GET /Items?Recursive=true&
  IncludeItemTypes=Movie|Series&ParentId=&fields=ProviderIds,MediaSources,DateCreated`
  (paged via StartIndex/Limit + TotalRecordCount). Series size = `GET
  /Items?ParentId={id}&Recursive=true&IncludeItemTypes=Episode&fields=MediaSources`,
  summing `MediaSources[].Size` deduped by `Path` (multi-episode files). ALL
  /Items reads page (watch history + episode reads too, via `fetchAllPages`) —
  a flat `Limit` silently truncates large sets. Size on disk =
  `MediaSources[].Size`; ids = `ProviderIds.{Tmdb,Tvdb}` → `guid_tmdb/guid_tvdb`; added =
  `DateCreated`; poster = `GET /Items/{id}/Images/Primary?fillWidth=&fillHeight=&api_key=`.
  Emby is the same API (only the auth-header version string differs). Unverified against a
  live server — built to the documented API + Seerr's client.
- **Tautulli**: `GET {url}/api/v2?apikey=&cmd=&out_type=json`; envelope
  `response.{result,message,data}`. `get_history` rows are at
  `response.data.data[]` (object); aggregate by `grandparent_rating_key`
  (episodes) / `rating_key` (movies).
- **Seerr**: base `/api/v1`, header `X-Api-Key`. Match the user to a Seerr user by
  email / plex / jellyfin username, then read `/user/{id}/requests`. Both `/user`
  and `/user/{id}/requests` are paged via `take`/`skip` (`seerrGetPaged`) — a
  single `take=200` drops users/requests past the first page. On Plex,
  `media.ratingKey` IS the rating key (direct join); on Jellyfin/Emby that isn't our
  item id, so we match the request's `media.tmdbId` (movies) / `tvdbId` (tv) to
  `media_items.guid_tmdb`/`guid_tvdb` via `ratingKeysByGuid`.
- **Sonarr/Radarr** (v3): base `{url}/api/v3`, header `X-Api-Key`. `GET /series`
  (`tvdbId`, `imdbId`, `monitored`, `status`, `qualityProfileId`, `statistics.sizeOnDisk`,
  `tags:number[]`) / `GET /movie` (`tmdbId`, `imdbId`, `monitored`, `status`, `sizeOnDisk`,
  `movieFile.quality.quality.name`, `tags:number[]`); resolve `tags`/profiles via
  `GET /tag` + `GET /qualityprofile`; `GET /system/status` for the Test button.
  Match `tvdbId→guid_tvdb` (shows) / `tmdbId→guid_tmdb` (movies), falling back to
  `imdbId→guid_imdb`. Series quality is the profile name (target); movie quality is the
  actual file quality.

## Conventions

- **Theming is CSS-variable-driven**: every used color family (slate ladder,
  brand, app/rail/panel surfaces, status hues) resolves through `--c-*`
  variables (`tailwind.config.ts` → `rgb(var(--c-…) / <alpha-value>)`), with
  the palettes in `app/globals.css` — `:root`/`[data-theme='dark']` (canonical,
  stock Tailwind values), `[data-theme='light']` (inverted slate ladder), and
  `[data-cim='1']` (color-impaired remap of rose/emerald/red only). A new
  color+shade needs a variable in every theme block. `data-theme`/`data-cim`
  are stamped on `<html>` pre-paint by the inline script in `app/layout.tsx`
  (localStorage `keeparr.theme` = auto|light|dark, `keeparr.colorImpaired`);
  `components/ThemeMenu.tsx` (in the AppShell user menu) edits them live.
  Two NON-themed constants: `ink` (dark text on brand-amber buttons/badges)
  and `paper` (true white on saturated badges over posters) — use these, not
  `text-slate-900`/`text-white`, when the surface doesn't change with theme.
- Plex-amber accent (`brand` in `tailwind.config.ts`).
- **Toasts**: `components/Toaster.tsx` — `ToastProvider` mounts once in
  AppShell; `useToast()(msg, 'info'|'success'|'error')` anywhere below it
  (no-op fallback without a provider, so hooks stay test-safe). Used for
  silent-failure paths (keep/skip/delete revert, feed/library/search/stats load
  errors + a failed Keep batch, job/backup actions); settings panels keep their
  inline `msg` text (success shown only after `res.ok`).
- **Dates in lists**: `formatRelative(unixSec)` from `lib/format.ts` as the
  visible text with the absolute `toLocaleString()` in `title` (hover).
- `lib/clipboard.ts copyText()` for all copy-to-clipboard (has the
  plain-HTTP fallback).
- **PWA**: `app/manifest.ts` (dynamic, uses `getAppTitle()`); icons in
  `public/icons/` are generated from `app/icon.svg` by
  `npx tsx scripts/gen-icons.mts` (rerun only when the logo changes). The
  manifest + `/icons/` are public in `middleware.ts` (credential-less fetch).
- **Keyboard**: global keys live in AppShell (`?` overlay, `/` focuses
  `#global-search`); add new shortcuts there + list them in
  `components/ShortcutsOverlay.tsx`.
- Server components guard admin pages and pass to client components that fetch
  their own data.
- Optimistic UI for keep toggles (revert on failure; any in-flight
  keep/skip/delete blocks the other two — the states are mutually exclusive, so
  interleaved requests would desync UI from server).
- **List fetchers guard against stale responses** with a per-component `useRef`
  sequence counter: capture `++seq` at fetch start; once superseded, drop the
  response (including its toast and `setLoading(false)`). See LibraryBrowser /
  SearchResults / StatsView / KeepView / SearchBox — new fetchers follow suit.
- Refresh work is split into scheduled jobs (`lib/jobs.ts`): `recentlyAdded` (cheap,
  newest items only), `library` (full inventory + movie sizes + new-show sizing),
  `sizes` (expensive per-series `getAllLeaves` recompute; also backfills show
  `dir_path` derived from episode paths), `watch` (Tautulli),
  `requests` (Seerr cache), `arr` (Sonarr/Radarr quality+tags cache), `diskScan`
  (disk-orphan scan over the mapped library paths, `lib/diskscan.ts` — gated in
  `lib/health.ts jobRelevant` on storage mappings existing), `backup`
  (db snapshot + retention prune, `lib/backup.ts`). Each is
  single-flight per `job_state`, fire-and-forget from `/api/admin/jobs`, auto-run by
  `lib/scheduler.ts` on its `job_schedules` entry (`isDue`: every N minutes/hours, daily
  at a local HH:MM, or weekly on a local weekday at HH:MM). Defaults in `config.ts` (`DEFAULT_JOB_SCHEDULES`): recentlyAdded
  5 min; library 03:00; watch 04:00; requests 05:00; sizes 06:00; arr 07:00;
  backup 08:00; diskScan weekly Sunday 09:00; **FORK:** rules 02:00 then purge
  02:30 (before the library scan so it reflects deletions; both inert unless
  `deletion_enabled`; bodies in `lib/rules.ts` / `lib/purge.ts`).
- **Releases + images (continuous delivery)**: every push to `main` ships one
  release via `.github/workflows/release.yml`: test (tsc + vitest + `next
  build`) → **version** → build (native amd64 + arm64, no QEMU) → publish
  `ghcr.io/drohack/keeparr:{latest,X.Y.Z,X.Y}` + a GitHub release. The
  **version** job auto-increments the PATCH unless you bumped `package.json`
  yourself: if `v<package.json version>` is already a tag it bumps (patch by
  default; minor/major via the `workflow_dispatch` `bump` input), else it uses
  your version as-is (manual override). Any bump is written back to main as a
  `[skip ci]` commit; GITHUB_TOKEN commits don't retrigger, so no loop. So: to
  cut a normal release just push to main; for a minor/major, bump
  `package.json` in your commit (or run the workflow manually with a bump
  level). `ci.yml` only validates PRs now (no image). The update check compares
  `package.json` to the newest GitHub Release. Tests are NOT in
  the Dockerfile (hoisted to CI); the Dockerfile must copy `public/`
  explicitly (standalone output omits it). `docker-entrypoint.sh`
  auto-generates SESSION_SECRET into `$DATA_DIR/.session-secret` when the env
  var is unset (env wins; it runs BEFORE node so the Edge middleware sees the
  same process.env — never move this into app code, Edge can't read files).
  The entrypoint runs as **root** (no `USER` line in the Dockerfile) solely to
  `chown -R $PUID:$PGID $DATA_DIR` (default `1001:1001`, Unraid `99:100`) — fixing
  a fresh root-owned bind mount — then drops privileges via `su-exec` before
  exec'ing node; the chown happens AFTER secret generation so `.session-secret`
  is re-owned and stays readable post-drop. Shell scripts are forced LF via
  .gitattributes (CRLF breaks alpine sh).
  Unraid users install via the
  Community Applications template (github.com/drohack/unraid-templates,
  `keeparr.xml`) — keep its port/paths/vars in sync with the Dockerfile when
  they change.
- ROADMAP.md tracks the researched platform-feature tiers: Tiers 1 (health/
  update/backups/API docs, v0.2.0) and 2 (themes/toasts/logs/PWA/shortcuts,
  v0.3.0) are done; Tier 3 is deliberately parked — don't build those without
  the user asking.
