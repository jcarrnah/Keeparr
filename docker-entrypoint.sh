# SESSION_SECRET handling (the Sonarr/Seerr pattern — no required secrets at
# install): if the env var is set it wins, unchanged. Otherwise a secret is
# generated ONCE and persisted at $DATA_DIR/.session-secret, living beside the
# database it protects (it signs sessions and encrypts stored service tokens),
# so appdata backups/moves carry it automatically.

# This runs BEFORE node starts so every runtime — including the Edge-sandboxed
# middleware, which cannot read files — sees the same process.env value.
