/**
 * Run the dev server against your REAL media server, in an isolated data dir.
 *
 *   npm run dev:real
 *
 * Why this exists: `npm run seed` + `KEEPARR_DEV_LOGIN=1` gives you a fake,
 * self-contained demo - great for UI work, useless for verifying anything that
 * actually talks to Plex. There was previously no supported way to exercise the
 * first-run setup, the Plex PIN login, or Discover & connect without deploying,
 * which meant those paths only ever got tested in production. This is that way.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT set KEEPARR_DEV_LOGIN and does NOT seed, so you get
 * the genuine first-run experience: setup -> Plex login -> Discover & connect ->
 * run jobs against your real libraries.
 *
 * DATA_DIR defaults to ./data-real so your demo data in ./data is untouched and
 * the two can coexist. Override with DATA_DIR=... if you want several.
