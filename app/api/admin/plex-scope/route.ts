/**
 * Can Keeparr read EVERY account's play history, or only the connected user's?
 *
 * "Connected" is not the useful question for Plex. A shared user's token
 * connects fine, scans libraries fine, and then silently returns only its own
 * watch history - so "never watched by anyone" quietly means "never watched by
 * one person". Nothing in the UI distinguished the two states, which is exactly
 * how a 4-year history got reported as one user's.
 *
 * Checks the token history ACTUALLY uses (the owner token when set, otherwise
 * the server token) by counting distinct accounts in a single page of history.
 * Measured at ~0.17s against a live server, so it is cheap enough to run when
 * the Connections page loads.
